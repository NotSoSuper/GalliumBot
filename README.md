# GalliumBot
A Discord bot for fun, moderation, and probably maybe some other stuff I dunno

Hi, I'm Ben, or Gallium as some of you know me. I do things with programming, like [bash scripts](https://github.com/benzarr410/command-line-fun). I'm also making a bot.

## So what's this all about?
It's just a bot, I mean, nothing really special about it.
## Can I have one?
Right now, the bot is in a very early stage, so I'm not allowing it to be used on other servers yet. But if you're determined, you can install nodejs and host it yourself, just please gib credits :3
## HEY, YOU COULD DO THIS BETTER!
Ok, jeez, calm down, i'm still learning. Just open up a [pull request](https://github.com/benzarr410/GalliumBot/pulls).
## HEY, THIS IS WRONG AND DOESN'T WORK!
Alright, open up an [issue](https://github.com/benzarr410/GalliumBot/issues), I'll see what I can do.
